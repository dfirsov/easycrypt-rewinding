# Reflection, Rewinding, and Coin-Toss in EasyCrypt

This repository (under the tag cpp2022) contains the snapshot of EasyCrypt code associated with the paper 
"D. Firsov, D. Unruh. Reflection, Rewinding, and Coin-Toss in EasyCrypt." published on CPP2022.

Setup
-----

* For this project we used the developement version of EasyCrypt (1.0)
theorem prover with git-hash: 512f0f2bd8dc8c1132f3cd138a17d57d4db9c514

* EasyCrypt was configured with support from the following SMT solvers:
Why3@1.4.0, Z3@4.8.7, CVC4@1.6, Alt-Ergo@2.4.0

* to check the development run:
  
  $> cd DEVELOPMENT_FOLDER
  $> bash checkall
